# Constitution Hash

**Purpose:** Document the canonical constitution hash and how it is derived.

**What will go here:**

- The accepted hash(es) for constitution v1 (e.g. used in GC view, verifier)
- How the hash is computed (e.g. from PACT_CONSTITUTION_V1.md) so auditors can reproduce

Placeholder. No protocol semantics changed; only documentation of existing hash usage.
