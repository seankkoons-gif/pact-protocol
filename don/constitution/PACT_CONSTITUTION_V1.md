# PACT Constitution v1

**Purpose:** Canonical text of the Pact Rules of Evidence and Responsibility Attribution (constitution v1).

**What will go here:**

- Full constitution text: rules applied by the verifier (DBL, evidence rules, responsibility attribution)
- Single source of truth for “what the verifier enforces”; no protocol semantics defined here that aren’t already in the verifier

Placeholder. Content will be the constitution body used for hash derivation and audit reference.
