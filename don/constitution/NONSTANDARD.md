# Nonstandard / Overrides

**Purpose:** Document any nonstandard or override configurations used in Don kits (e.g. for demos or specific partners).

**What will go here:**

- List of overrides or nonstandard options (if any) used in design partner packs or viewer defaults
- Clear note that these do not change protocol semantics; they only affect packaging, defaults, or display

Placeholder. Content will clarify what is “standard” vs “kit-specific” without altering verification rules.
