# Trust Signals

**Purpose:** Document what trust signals a Don release provides (signing, hashes, provenance).

**What will go here:**

- What is signed or hashed (packs, scripts, constitution)
- How recipients can verify integrity and provenance of the kit
- No new protocol semantics; only documentation of how we signal trust for packaged evidence

Placeholder. Content will describe signing, hashes, and any provenance metadata for Don releases.
