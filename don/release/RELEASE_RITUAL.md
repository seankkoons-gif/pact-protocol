# Release Ritual

**Purpose:** Step-by-step checklist for cutting a Don release (design partner kit + viewer + docs).

**What will go here:**

- Order of operations: build verifier, generate packs, run verify_all, tag, upload
- What gets included in a Don release (packs, scripts, constitution docs, viewer)
- Reminder: no protocol semantics changed; release only packages and documents existing evidence

Placeholder. Content will be the canonical release checklist for Don.
