# Conformance Fixtures

**Purpose:** Document the fixtures used to assert conformance of the verifier and evidence format.

**What will go here:**

- List of conformance fixtures (e.g. success, failure, tier demos) and what they prove
- Where they live (e.g. fixtures/, design_partner_kit/packs/) and how they are used in CI or verify_all
- Note: fixtures encode existing protocol semantics; Don does not change those semantics

Placeholder. Content will point to existing fixtures and describe their role in release/conformance.
