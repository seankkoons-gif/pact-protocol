# Evidence Viewer (Don)

Evidence Viewer is currently **v0** (app version 0.1.x). The implementation lives at [apps/evidence-viewer](../../apps/evidence-viewer). This folder tracks Don-level documentation and release expectations only.

**Purpose:** Docs and packaging for the evidence viewer app used by design partners and auditors.

**What will go here:**

- **README.md** (this file) — What the evidence viewer is: GC view, insurer summary, claims package, passport panel; how to run it; how it consumes existing Pact evidence (no protocol changes)
- Links or instructions to the app and how Don packages it for distribution

Don only packages and documents the viewer; it does not change how evidence is produced or verified.
