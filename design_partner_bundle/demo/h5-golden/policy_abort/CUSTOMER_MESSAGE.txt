TRANSACTION ABORTED - POLICY CONSTRAINT

Your transaction was automatically terminated because the provider's offer
did not meet your pre-configured policy requirements. This is a protective
measure that prevented you from accepting terms outside your specified
constraints.

RESPONSIBILITY: The buyer's policy constraints could not be satisfied by
the available provider. This is not an error - your policy worked as
designed to protect you from unwanted terms.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT: Review your policy settings and consider whether they
should be adjusted. You may retry with different providers or modified
policy parameters.

MONEY MOVED: No - no funds were committed or transferred. The transaction
was terminated before any financial commitment was made.

HOW TO VERIFY: Run the following command to independently verify this
transaction:

    pact-verifier auditor-pack-verify --zip auditor_pack_101.zip

A successful verification will show "ok": true in the output.
