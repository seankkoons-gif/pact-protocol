VERIFICATION FAILED - TAMPERING DETECTED

The transaction record you submitted has been altered after it was
originally created. The verification system detected that derived
documents do not match what would be computed from the original
signed transcript.

RESPONSIBILITY: Unknown - tampering was detected but the responsible
party cannot be determined from the evidence alone. This could indicate
malicious modification, storage corruption, or software error.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT: This record cannot be relied upon for dispute
resolution or claims processing. Contact support for investigation.
The original signed rounds may still have forensic value.

MONEY MOVED: Unknown - the integrity of this record is compromised
and its claims cannot be trusted without further investigation.

HOW TO VERIFY: Run the following command to confirm the tamper detection:

    pact-verifier auditor-pack-verify --zip auditor_pack_semantic_tampered.zip

Verification will show "ok": false and "recompute_ok": false.
